    "# Safety CLI Quickstart Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Safety CLI is a Python dependency vulnerability scanner designed to enhance software supply chain security by detecting packages with known vulnerabilities and malicious packages in local development environments, CI/CD, and production systems. Safety CLI can be deployed in minutes and provides clear, actionable recommendations for remediation of detected vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging the industry's most comprehensive database of vulnerabilities and malicious packages, Safety CLI Scanner allows teams to detect vulnerabilities at every stage of the software development lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "To install Safety, run the following command (please ignore the `%%capture` text, this is just to suppress jupyter notebook output):\n"
