# Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Issue Management

We are committed to maintaining a high level of responsiveness and transparency in managing issues reported in our codebases. This SLA outlines our policies and procedures for handling issues to ensure timely resolutions and effective communication with our community.


## Response Times

### Initial Acknowledgment
* Automated Reply: Upon submission of a new issue, an automated response is sent within minutes via GitHub Actions.
### First Human Response
* Response Time: A member of our team will respond within 24-48 hours to acknowledge the issue and provide initial feedback or request further information if necessary.
### Bug Triage
* Triage Time: Issues will be triaged within 72 hours to classify them appropriately (e.g., bugs, feature requests, questions).

## Resolution Time
Goals: While we strive to meet these resolution times, they are goals and not hard promises. We will do our best to resolve:
* Critical Bugs: Within 1 week.
* High-Priority Bugs: Within 2 weeks.
* Medium-Priority Bugs: Within 1 month.
* Low-Priority Bugs: Within 2 months.
* Enhancements: Scheduled based on the project roadmap.

## Priority Levels
* Critical: Issues that break core functionality or pose significant security vulnerabilities.
* High: Significant bugs affecting many users with possible workarounds.
* Medium: Bugs affecting a smaller subset of users or those with simple workarounds.
* Low: Minor bugs or cosmetic issues.
* Enhancements: Improvements and new features will be scheduled according to the project roadmap and community input.

## Communication
### Status Updates
* Regular Updates: We strive to provide regular updates on the progress of unresolved issues and keep everyone informed of our progress.

### Escalation Path
* Escalation: If an issue is not addressed within the expected timeframe, users can escalate the matter by tagging the assignee of the issue or contacting Dylan at dylan@safetycli.com.

## Labels
To better organize and prioritize issues, we use the following labels:
* bug: Identifies a problem that needs to be fixed.
* considering: Indicates that the issue is under consideration.
* duplicate: Marks issues that have already been reported.
* invalid: Applied to issues that are not valid or relevant.
* enhancement: Suggests an improvement or new feature.
* question: Indicates a question or request for information.
* wontfix: Marks issues that will not be addressed.
* good first issue: Highlights issues that are suitable for first-time contributors.
Each label helps us to classify and prioritize issues effectively, ensuring that they are handled in a timely and organized manner.


## Procedure for Handling New Issues
1. Automated Acknowledgment: Upon issue submission, an automated message is sent to the reporter.
2. First Human Response: Within 24-48 hours, a team member will review the issue and provide initial feedback.
3. Triage: Within 72 hours, the issue will be classified into one of the priority levels.
4. Assignment: The issue will be assigned to the appropriate team member or team for resolution.
5. Status Updates: Regular updates will be provided to the reporter, especially at key milestones.
6. Resolution: The issue will be resolved within the timeframe specified for its priority level.
7. Closure: Once resolved, the issue will be closed, and the resolution will be documented for future reference.

We value the contributions and feedback from our community and strive to foster a collaborative and responsive environment. Thank you for helping us improve and maintain the quality of our project.
