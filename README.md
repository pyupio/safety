# Introduction
Safety CLI is a Python dependency vulnerability scanner designed to enhance software supply chain security by detecting packages with known vulnerabilities and malicious packages in local development environments, CI/CD, and production systems.
Safety CLI can be deployed in minutes and provides clear, actionable recommendations for remediation of detected vulnerabilities.

Leveraging the industry's most comprehensive database of vulnerabilities and malicious packages, Safety CLI Scanner allows teams to detect vulnerabilities at every stage of the software development lifecycle.

# Key Features
- Versatile, comprehensive dependency security scanning for Python packages.
- Leverages Safety DB, the most comprehensive vulnerability data available for Python.
- Clear output with detailed recommendations for vulnerability remediation.
- Automatically updates requirements files to secure versions of dependencies where available, guided by your project's policy settings.
- Scanning of individual requirements files and project directories or system-wide scans on developer machines, CI/CD pipelines, and Production systems to detect vulnerable or malicious dependencies.
- JSON, SBOM, HTML and text output.
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines, including GitHub Actions.
- Enterprise Ready: Safety CLI can be deployed to large teams with complex project setups with ease, on-premise or as a SaaS product.

# Getting Started
## GitHub Action

- Test Safety CLI in CI/CD using our [GitHub Action](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-action).
- Full documentation on the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-action) is available on our [Documentation Hub](https://docs.safetycli.com).

## Command Line Interface

### 1. Installation

- Install Safety on your development machine.
- Run `pip install safety`.

### 2. Log In or Register

- Run your first scan using `safety scan`.
- If not authenticated, Safety will prompt for account creation or login.
- Use `safety auth` to check authentication status.

### 3. Running Your First Scan

- Navigate to a project directory and run `safety scan`.
- Safety will perform a scan and present results in the Terminal.

## Basic Commands

- `safety --help`: Access help and display all available commands.
- `safety auth`: Start authentication flow or display status.
- `safety scan`: Perform a vulnerability scan in the current directory.
- `safety system-scan`: Perform a scan across the entire development machine.
- `safety scan --apply-fixes`: Update vulnerable dependencies.
